# TerminalTalk
 A Network Chat Application in Java

## Plans on how to start

In one instance, start a server port.

From there, other instances should be clients. The clients connect to the server port and be able to chat with one another.


# W.I.P

### TODO:
- Test Server and Client
- Add a Server Loop and Client Loop
- Create ServerMain and ClientMain
- Work on Terminal Parsing and Terminal Loop
